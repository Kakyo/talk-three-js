## Your talk

 - Should last no more than 50 minutes, leave up to 10 minutes for questions.
 - Should not be too deep neither too superficial.
 - Give at least 3 reference links to be followed for further studies.
 - Give a challenge that would be solved using ideas that were covered on the talk.
 - It is ok to go a little bit far (forcing the attendee to do some research), but that should be optional.

----

## Organization

 - 1st slide: the cover, featuring your talk name, your name, the lecture date and AC logo.
 - 2nd slide: the agenda, in topics.
 - 3nd slide: the prerequisites of your talk.
 - From 4th slide on: your content
  - When content from the same topic doesn't fit on a slide -> grow it VERTICALLY by adding a slide below (----).
  - When you finish a topic and will start a different one -> grow it HORIZONTALLY by adding a slide to the right (---).
 - The 3 last slides: Conclusion, Learn more (with the reference links) and Challenge.

## The DO's

1. BE BALANCED BETWEEN THEORY AND PRACTICE. Your target is keeping the subject interesting for everybody.
1. BE CONSISTENT. Please watch some good screencasts in order to learn how to use your voice and conduct the talk.
1. BE POLITE. Don't use slangs neither bad words.
1. BE OBJECTIVE. Don't overexplain in such way you could cause confusion to your attendees.
1. KEEP THE FOCUS. Off-topic discussions are ok, but only if it doesn't disturb the natural flow of your content.
1. BE PREPARED. If you are going to use examples or live coding, make sure you have them all prepared beforehand.
1. TRAIN your full talk at least once before your talk.

----

## The DONT's

1. DO NEVER SHOW REAL CODE FROM THE CLIENT. This is CRITICAL and can cause serious problems.
1. DON'T BE ARROGANT. Be humble and don't focus the talk on yourself.
1. DON'T GENERALIZE, specially stuff that you are not sure about.
1. DON'T MAKE UP DATA. Base yourself on trustable references.
1. DON'T BE BORING. Just be yourself. It is ok to joke around, but don't exaggerate.

----

## Tips

* ENJOY your experience by creating the talk, because you will surely learn MUCH MORE than your attendees.
* BRING WATER to drink while you present. You will certainly need it!
* BE OPEN to receive questions and even criticism. You will learn a lot from them.
* ALWAYS be polite when talking to your audience. This will always open doors for you.
* People might come to you with questions and more complex cases after your talk. Consider it as a gift, it means you represent something good for them!
